# 3D-Klipper-TronXY5SA

Modifying a TronXY5SA to use a SKR 1.4 Turbo board and a Raspberry PI running OctoPi and Klipper.

STL and Fusion 360 file for a custom case to hold it all.

Be sure you have good thermal control.  The case can warp and lift off the bed if cooled too rapidly.  You might need to turn on supports for the corner screw blocks for a lid.

Power supply is a MEAN WELL RSP-500-24
