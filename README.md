# 3D-Klipper-TronXY5SA

Modifying a TronXY5SA to use a SKR 1.4 Turbo board and a Raspberry PI running OctoPi and Klipper.

STL and Fusion 360 file for a custom case to hold it all.

Be sure you have good thermal control.  The case can warp and lift off the bed if cooled too rapidly.  You might need to turn on supports for the corner screw blocks for a lid.

Power supply is a MEAN WELL RSP-500-24

BCZAMD 3D Printer Heating Controller MKS MOSFET

The Z adjust blocks are spacers for doing the initial Z sync on the stepper motors.  Put one on each side and bottom out (stall the motors) the bed rails.  Lower bed, remove and continue 

Carriage bracket for BMG Direct Extruder and a Dragon Hotend with BLTouch.

Use supports for the parts fan.  The BMG extruder mount does not need supports.  I printed mine with PETG. 

Designed with 50mm centrifugal fans from Winsinn
